This project is a modern web application built with a mobile-first, user-friendly, and enterprise-ready UI. It is designed to display information in a clear and structured way by using consistent layouts, reusable components, and well-defined UI/UX patterns. The architecture focuses on scalability, maintainability, and clean code practices, making the application easy to extend and improve over time. Special attention is given to responsive design so the interface works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. During development, some data shown in the application may be for demonstration purposes and may not always be fully up to date.
